## Description
### A Collection of projects from my PHYS 377: Advanced Computational Physics course, these include noteworthy techniques such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item The Metropolis algorithm, a Monte-Carlo Markov method, to predict the magnetization of the 2D Ising model
\item The Forward-Time Centered-Space Method to solve the diffusion equation 
\item Combining Runge-Kutta 4 and Secant, which are differential equation and root-finding method respectively, into the Shooting method to approximate the solutions to the quantum anharmonic oscilator
\end{itemize}
