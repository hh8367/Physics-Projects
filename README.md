## Description
#### A Collection of projects from my PHYS 377: Advanced Computational Physics course, these include noteworthy techniques such as:
- [Custom Kernel GPR](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.6.033069) (Physics-Informed Machine Learning) for Heat Equation Simulation. This method embeds the differential equation's properties directly into the GPR prior, enabling accurate function reconstruction from sparse data points 
- The Metropolis algorithm, a Monte-Carlo Markov method, to predict the magnetization of the 2D Ising model
- The Forward-Time Centered-Space Method to solve the diffusion equation 
- Combining Runge-Kutta 4 and Secant, which are differential equation and root-finding method respectively, into the Shooting method to approximate the solutions to the quantum anharmonic oscilator
